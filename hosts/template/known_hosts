<generate me>

First, generate ./host_key and fill out the IP address in your host configuration.

Optionally, adjust the 'deployment.sshPort' and 'deployment.boot.sshPort' in your host configuration if you want to use non-standard ports.

Then, use this command to generate known_hosts:

nix run .#gen-knownhosts-file

Or manually:
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 -p <port> <ip-or-hostname> >> known_hosts
